## 🚀 How to Use

### Process a Single Book

```bash
cd /Users/eerogetlost/book-processor-local

# Process and save report:
./scripts/upload_text.sh ~/Downloads/YourBook.pdf

### Process Multiple Books

```bash
# Batch process:
for book in ~/Downloads/*.pdf; do
    echo "Processing: $(basename "$book")"
    ./scripts/upload_text.sh "$book"
    sleep 5  # Give workflow time to complete
done

# View all reports:
open reports/*.html
```

### View Reports

```bash

python3 scripts/generate_subgenre_embeddings.py
```

### Switch Embedding Models
```bash
# 1. Pull new model:
ollama pull <model-name>

# 2. Update scripts/generate_subgenre_embeddings.py
#    Change EMBEDDING_MODEL = "snowflake-arctic-embed"

# 3. Regenerate embeddings:
python3 scripts/generate_subgenre_embeddings.py

# 4. Update workflow Generate Embeddings node
#    Change model parameter
```

### Clean Old Reports
```bash
# Delete reports older than 30 days:
find reports/ -name "*.html" -mtime +30 -delete
find reports/ -name "*.txt" -mtime +30 -delete
find reports/ -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete
```
